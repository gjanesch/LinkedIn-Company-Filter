This is meant to be a small Firefox extension that can screen out job postings from undesired companies (or possibly other filters) that appear in a LinkedIn job search.

Currently trying to parse code from the following to assist this extension:
- https://github.com/Robert01101101/hide-applied-jobs-linkedin/tree/main (seems to be a Chrome extension, but matches some of the functionality I want and the Firefox add-on list shows it...)
- https://github.com/canklot/Linkedin_Promoted_Hider (filters out promoted jobs, which may help)
